# preference-learning-from-selection
I just wanna do preference learning from a set of demonstrations instead of two 

Once you install, go to this folder and run:
```
python3 -m pip install -e .
```

otherwise you will get import errors when you run the examples.
You will also probably need to pip install some things. I believe the core of
this library just uses:

```
python3 -m pip install tqdm numpy scipy matplotlib
```

see the readmes in the examples directories for their specific pip requirements.
